## Inspiration
This was created as a proof of concept for our team in the IEOR190C class hosted at UC Berkeley. We worked on it from from October 3, 2014 to October 5, 2014 and submitted it for
[CalHacks](http://calhacks.io/).

## Purpose
This app is designed to encourage customers at restaurants to leave detailed reviews about each dish or server that they had
in order to generate custom analytics for the restaurant. 

## Idea
We could facilitate this by placing QR codes on receipts that corresponds to the individual receipts. This way a user could load
a digital receipt on their mobile phone and be able to click through their receipt to leave feedback. We'd like to expand this so much more,
some directions we were thinking of taking this was to use our app as the payment gateway, and having our app act as the menu as well
and perhaps even allow ordering off the mobile phone.

## Usage
The [web app](http://delight-food.appspot.com/review) is currently running live and showcases some sample data that a restaurant
would be able to see if our app was used. The android app is currently only contained within this app and requires a library
(that is not currently included) in order to scan the QR codes.

## Furthur Implications
We are no longer working on this app. We ran into technical challenges of being able to integrate with payment systems
in order to put QR codes on receipts and also struggled to get restaurants to talk to us about (let alone sell) a product
like this to them. This app remains in generally its original state from the hackathon and thus has no concept of users
and has a hardcoded business.
